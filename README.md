How does access to and satisfaction with modern family planning methods 
among married or in-union women of reproductive age, impact reproductive 
health outcomes and maternal well-being? 

Sub-questions to guide the analysis: 
1. Access to Family Planning: How does access to modern family planning methods vary across different 
regions and socioeconomic groups? 

2. Reproductive Health Outcomes: What is the correlation between access to modern family planning methods and 
adolescent birth rates? 

3. Maternal Well-being: Are there correlations between family planning access and maternal healthcare-
seeking behavior, such as antenatal care attendance and skilled birth attendance?
