Women's health encompasses a diverse array of physical, mental, and social well-being concerns unique to females. This includes maternal and reproductive health, which focuses on aspects such as pregnancy, childbirth, and reproductive choices. Maternal health emphasizes prenatal care, safe delivery practices, and postpartum support, aiming to reduce maternal and infant mortality rates and promote healthy pregnancies. Reproductive health further encompasses family planning and access to reproductive healthcare services, crucial for empowering women to make informed decisions about their reproductive futures. Addressing these multifaceted issues requires comprehensive healthcare strategies that recognize the intersection of biological factors, societal norms, and healthcare access, thereby promoting the overall well-being of women throughout their lives.

Main question: How does access to and satisfaction with modern family planning methods 
among married or in-union women of reproductive age, impact reproductive 
health outcomes and maternal well-being? 
 - Mental health (psychological well-being such as depression, strees, anxiety)
 - Skilled birth attendance (count with doctors, nurses and midwives support) 
 - Postpartum support (health care for mothers within the first months)

Sub-questions to guide the analysis: 
1. Access to Family Planning: How does access to modern family planning methods vary across different 
regions and socioeconomic groups? 

2. Reproductive Health Outcomes: What is the correlation between access to modern family planning methods and 
adolescent birth rates?

3. Maternal Well-being: Are there correlations between family planning access and maternal healthcare-
seeking behavior, such as antenatal care attendance and skilled birth attendance?

Assumptions:
* When the period of study was done between 2 years (i.e. 2022-2023), it is assumed that the results of that particular study corresponds to 12 months and it is a reflection of the latest year (2023).__
* The datasets were broken down in intervals of 3 years each starting in 2003 to 2023 to allow consistent analysis of data over time.
* The study was done in married and in-union women of reproductive age, which is assumed to be between 15-49 years.
* Assumed the same collecting data method accross countries.

Limitations:
* There are more indicators that could have been analyzed to contribute to the overall hypothesis. We focused on 4 key indicators due to time constrainsts.
* Period data was not standardized accross datasets. Some assumptions needed to be made to standardize it and make them fully comparable.
